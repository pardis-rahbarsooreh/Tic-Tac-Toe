# Tic Tac Toe agent
In this project, me and my teammate @behkamfallah have designed a tic tac toe agent using the Python's [gymnasium](https://pypi.org/project/gymnasium/) library. The **Function Approximation** method is used to learn the weight of a set of features for this game. 


### Important Notes

* Environment Dynamics, Initial State, Rewards, Executable actions, etc. are explained in detail in the jupyter notebook file.

* The presented learning algorithm is explained in details in the jupyter notebook file.

* The statistical reports based on different learning rates are included in the jupyter notebook file.

* This project uses the Python's [gymnasium](https://pypi.org/project/gymnasium/) library. The version and how to install is explained in the jupyter notebook file.

* Tic Tac Toe is a two agent game, however, in this project, the second agent's behaviour is part of the environment and is defined beforehead in the `Opponent_Policies` folder. 



P.S. This is a project done in a university course *Reinforcement Learning* in the winter semester 2023/2024 at Saarland University under supervision of Prof. Verena Wolf and her team. Therefore, the notebook is in the Exercise format. All the related information on how much of the project is given by the professor and how much is done by me and @behkamfallah is already explained in the notebook.
